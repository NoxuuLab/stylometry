In the days that followed, I lost myself in the old books at my father’s library. I could not read them all, of course; but I read a great many of them. I rose early, before the sun, and then I could not sleep at night. I had a nameless, restless energy; but I did not know what to do with it. I was interested in many things. I tried to learn a few new languages, but I was not very good at them. I composed music and wandered about the countryside, and I read books. But I was most interested in talking to the people who lived in the vicinity of Geneva. I had always been sociable and eager to make new friends, but never before had I had the opportunity to talk so often to so many people. I was about sixteen years old when I remember that I first met one of the most interesting of the people I met in Switzerland. He was a man in his early twenties, dressed as a farmer, who was walking along the shore of the lake, and I stopped to talk to him. His name was Frankenstein and he had come to Geneva to attend the university, but he found the atmosphere of the city to be stifling, and so he often left it to walk in the mountains. He was the son of a clergyman, a Protestant pastor. The thing that made Frankenstein so interesting was the combination of a very deep thinking temperament with a sportive and joyous nature. He was a very animated, quick-thinking young man, but his gaiety was like the gaiety of a child. When we first met, he had been engaged to a girl from the next village; but she broke the engagement, and it was said that she was afraid of my father, because of the dark stories that she had heard about him. Frankenstein’s father had been preaching in a village about twenty miles from Geneva, and he had heard about his son’s troubles. One Sunday he came to visit him, and asked him to come back with him. “But I cannot,” said Frankenstein. “I am too happy here. I have found some friends at last, and I am sure that I should be very miserable if I had to leave them.” “I am sorry to hear that,” said his father. “Then I will ask you to come back with me. I will preach in this village and I will live with you.” “That is a kind offer, but I would be too uncomfortable. I have some friends in Geneva, and I have a life in Geneva. I am really quite happy here.” “Very well,” said his father. “We will not discuss it any more. I will go back to the village and I will preach there. But I want you to come back with me.” “Very well,” said Frankenstein. “I will come back with you, but I will only stay for a few weeks.” “I am very glad,” said his father. “But you must not forget the teaching that I give you. You must not forget God. “I will not forget,” said Frankenstein. “I will not forget.” This is an example of a short story.
