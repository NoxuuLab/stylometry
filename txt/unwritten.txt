In the days that followed, I lost myself in the old books at my father’s library. I could not read them all, of course; but I read a great many of them. I rose early, before the sun, and then I could not sleep at night. I had a nameless, restless energy; but I did not know what to do with it. I was interested in many things. I tried to learn a few new languages, but I was not very good at them. I composed music and wandered about the countryside, and I read books. But I was most interested in talking to the people who lived in the vicinity of Geneva. I had always been sociable and eager to make new friends, but never before had I had the opportunity to talk so often to so many people. I was about sixteen years old when I remember that I first met one of the most interesting of the people I met in Switzerland. He was a man in his early twenties, dressed as a farmer, who was walking along the shore of the lake, and I stopped to talk to him. His name was Frankenstein and he had come to Geneva to attend the university, but he found the atmosphere of the city to be stifling, and so he often left it to walk in the mountains. He was the son of a clergyman, a Protestant pastor. The thing that made Frankenstein so interesting was the combination of a very deep thinking temperament with a sportive and joyous nature. He was a very animated, quick-thinking young man, but his gaiety was like the gaiety of a child. When we first met, he had been engaged to a girl from the next village; but she broke the engagement, and it was said that she was afraid of my father, because of the dark stories that she had heard about him. Frankenstein’s father had been preaching in a village about twenty miles from Geneva, and he had heard about his son’s troubles. One Sunday he came to visit him, and asked him to come back with him. “But I cannot,” said Frankenstein. “I am too happy here. I have found some friends at last, and I am sure that I should be very miserable if I had to leave them.” “I am sorry to hear that,” said his father. “Then I will ask you to come back with me. I will preach in this village and I will live with you.” “That is a kind offer, but I would be too uncomfortable. I have some friends in Geneva, and I have a life in Geneva. I am really quite happy here.” “Very well,” said his father. “We will not discuss it any more. I will go back to the village and I will preach there. But I want you to come back with me.” “Very well,” said Frankenstein. “I will come back with you, but I will only stay for a few weeks.” “I am very glad,” said his father. “But you must not forget the teaching that I give you. You must not forget God. “I will not forget,” said Frankenstein. “I will not forget.” This is an example of a short story.



t was a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife. This truth was not, however, so universally acknowledged by single men of good fortune, as to prevent their occasional desire for change. Among these was a certain Mr. Edward Mountfort, who, after having been married for some years to a lady whom he still dearly loved, began to feel restless and discontented. He had every reason to be happy, and yet he was not. He was rich, handsome, and talented; he had a beautiful and loving wife, and yet he could not help but feel that something was lacking in his life. One day, as he was walking through a cemetery, he came across a strange-looking old man, who seemed to be gazing at him intently. The old man's eyes were so piercing that Edward felt as if he could see into his very soul. "Who are you?" Edward asked, feeling both intrigued and unnerved by the old man's gaze. "I am Death," the old man replied. Edward was startled, but he did not fear Death. Instead, he felt a sudden and intense curiosity. "Tell me," he said, "what is it like to die?" "It is like nothing you can imagine," Death replied. "It is a great and terrible mystery." Edward was even more intrigued now, and he begged Death to tell him more. "Very well," Death said. "But first, you must give me something in return." "Anything!" Edward exclaimed. "You must give me your life," Death replied. Edward hesitated for a moment, but then he nodded his assent. He knew that he would never find anything more interesting than the answer to his question, and so he was willing to trade his life for it. "Very well," Death said. "Then let me tell you what it is like to die." And so Death told Edward about the mystery of death, and Edward listened intently. He learned that death was not an end, but a beginning; that it was not something to be feared, but something to be embraced. He learned that in death, he would finally understand the true meaning of life. When Death had finished speaking, Edward thanked him and then lay down on the ground, ready to die. He closed his eyes and surrendered himself to the mystery. And then, something miraculous happened. Edward found himself still alive, and unchanged. He opened his eyes and saw that the old man was gone, and in his place was a beautiful young woman. "Who are you?" Edward asked, astonished. "I am Life," the woman replied. "And I have come to give you a second chance." Edward was overjoyed, and he vowed to make the most of his second chance. He went home to his wife and told her everything that had happened, and from that day on, he was a changed man. He was no longer restless or discontent, but was filled with a new sense of purpose. He knew that he had been given a gift, and he was determined to use it to make the world a better place.
